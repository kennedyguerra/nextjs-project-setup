# Detailed Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the changes needed to create a Next.js site with a meme gallery and accessibility features that allow users to adjust font sizes and color themes. The following dependent files will be created or updated, ensuring error handling and best practices across the codebase.

---

## 1. Global Accessibility Context

**File:** `src/context/AccessibilityContext.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Manage global state for the current font size and theme.

**Steps:**
- Create a new context using `React.createContext`.
- Define the state properties:
  - `fontSize` (e.g., a number or string value such as "medium") with default value.
  - `theme` with default value `"light"`.
- Implement functions:
  - `increaseFontSize` and `decreaseFontSize` to update `fontSize`.
  - `setTheme` to update the color theme; include options for `"light"`, `"dark"`, and `"high-contrast"`.
- Wrap the context in an `AccessibilityProvider` component and export it.
- Add try/catch in state update functions to catch and log errors.

---

## 2. Global CSS Update

**File:** `src/app/globals.css`

**Purpose:**  
Add CSS variables and theme classes to support dynamic font sizes and color schemes.

**Steps:**
- Define CSS variables at the root (e.g., `--font-size-base`, `--color-background`, `--color-text`).
- Create theme classes:
  - `.theme-light` with light background and dark text.
  - `.theme-dark` with dark background and light text.
  - `.theme-high-contrast` with highly contrasting colors.
- Add responsive styling rules using rem/em units to ensure font size adjustments affect the entire site.
- Ensure proper spacing and layout reset for a modern, minimalistic design.

---

## 3. Layout File

**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Wrap the entire application with the Accessibility Context provider and apply theme classes dynamically.

**Steps:**
- Create a new `layout.tsx` (if not already present) that sets up the HTML structure.
- Import and wrap the children with `<AccessibilityProvider>`.
- Use the accessibility context to apply a dynamic class (e.g., using the current theme) on the `<body>` or top-level `<div>`.
- Include `<head>` meta tags and link the global CSS.
- Handle any potential errors in context initialization gracefully.

---

## 4. Accessibility Controls Component

**File:** `src/components/AccessibilityControls.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Provide UI buttons for adjusting font size and switching themes.

**Steps:**
- Create a new component that imports the accessibility context.
- Render buttons:
  - "Increase Font" calls `increaseFontSize`.
  - "Decrease Font" calls `decreaseFontSize`.
  - Theme selection buttons (e.g., "Light", "Dark", "High Contrast") call `setTheme` with the appropriate string.
- Style buttons with modern typography, spacing, and color variants without using external icons or image libraries.
- Use event handler wrappers with try/catch blocks to prevent crashes from unexpected state errors.
- Use descriptive aria-labels for better accessibility.

## 5. Gallery Page for Meme Display

**File:** `src/app/gallery/page.tsx`

**Purpose:**  
Display a responsive gallery of memes with error handling for image loading.

**Steps:**
- Create a new page component that imports and uses `<AccessibilityControls>` at its top.
- Define an array of meme objects (each with properties such as `src` and `alt`) to simulate a real-world meme list.  
  *Example meme image:*
  ```jsx
  <img 
    src="https://placehold.co/300x300?text=Sample+Meme+Image" 
    alt="Sample meme image depicting humorous content in a modern style layout" 
    onError={(e) => { e.currentTarget.src = "https://placehold.co/300x300?text=Image+Not+Found"; }} 
  />
  ```
- Use CSS Grid (or Flexbox) to create a responsive grid layout for the meme images.
- Ensure each `<img>` tag includes an `onError` handler to fallback to a default placeholder if the image fails to load.
- Add a header title (e.g., "Meme Gallery") with accessible typography adjustments based on the contextâ€™s `fontSize`.

---

## 6. Testing and Error Handling

**General Guidelines:**
- Wrap event handler code in try/catch blocks and log errors to the console.
- Test all new components using different viewport sizes and ensure that changes in font size and theme are applied across the site.
- Verify that missing meme images trigger the `onError` fallback.
- Manually inspect the DOM to ensure that theme classes (e.g., `.theme-dark`) are applied to the root element when selected.

---

## Summary

- Created an Accessibility Context (`src/context/AccessibilityContext.tsx`) to manage font size and theme.
- Updated `src/app/globals.css` to include CSS variables and theme-specific styles.
- Implemented a new root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) that wraps all pages with the Accessibility Provider.
- Developed an Accessibility Controls component (`src/components/AccessibilityControls.tsx`) with buttons for font size and theme changes.
- Built a Gallery page (`src/app/gallery/page.tsx`) that presents memes in a responsive grid with proper image error handling.
- This integration ensures a modern, accessible, and responsive site with usability in focus.
